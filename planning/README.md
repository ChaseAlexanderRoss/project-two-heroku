# Simple Reddit Clone
    My Project is a simple reddit clone, meant for people to post links and write descriptions of whatever they want to post. My project simply gives people the freedom to express their ideas and show other people what they're thinking about/doing 

## Getting Started:
    First, you're going to want to make sure you have Mongodb, Express, Handlebars, and Node installed on your computer. Fork and Clone down the repo from github, and then navigate down to the appropriate the folder in your directory. Next, you'll want to open two (2) terminal windows in the appropriate directory as well. In the first terminal, you'll run the command ```mongod```. The terminal should show a bunch of white text, and then look like it's waiting for a command. Just leave it. Open up the other terminal window and type in the command ```nodemon``` (if that doesn't work try ```npx nodemon```). This should then tell you that the app is listening on port 3000: that's what you want to see. Once that is there, go ahead and switch over to a browser of your choice, and type in "localhost:3000" and you'll be able to see the reddit clone!!
